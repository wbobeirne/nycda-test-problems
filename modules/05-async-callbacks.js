// Not all code runs in a linear order, and not all code executes at the same
// time. This is called asynchronous code, and can be tricky to manage. Using
// callbacks is a common way to handle asynchronous code, so we'll practice
// some of that here.
//
// If any of what we cover below is unfamiliar, read the following article to
// review async & callbacks (Just the first parts, stop at "Tools..."):
// https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/front-end-javascript/introduction-to-asynchronous-javascript
//
// You can also review the class slides for node-style callbacks here:
