// Now we're going to be demonstrating all of the basic data types in js. This
// quiz is going to check the keys of an object we export, and check that the
// value is of the correct type. So for "string", you'll want it to be a string,
// "number" should be a number etc.
//
// It doesn't matter what the values are, you could put any number or string,
// just so long as it's of the correct type.
//
// If any of these are unfamiliar, or you'd like to see examples, you can find
// some here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp

module.exports = {
	// ***** START EDITING HERE ***** //
	string: "string",
	number: 123,
	boolean: false,
	array: [1, 2, 3],
	object: { property: "value" },
	// ***** STOP EDITING HERE ***** //
};
